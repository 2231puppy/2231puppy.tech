[{"content":"What life? Why exist? How live? Why do I mean? If you find yourself asking asking these big questions, you\u0026rsquo;re probably a robot. No offense, ChatGPT. A real human would be asking much more important questions of themselves:\nHow the heck do I run KiCad on Android? Because there\u0026rsquo;s nothing more important in life than running an open-source EDA suite on your smartphone.\nWhether or not that assumption is correct doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter. Considering that the universe will probably expand and collapse an infinite amount of times, that means that KiCad will be created an infinite amount of times as well. If you don\u0026rsquo;t believe me, see the infinite monkey theorem. Somewhere, sometime, it was bound to happen: A bored 15 year old gets the best open-source PCB design tool to work under a mobile operating system.\nBUT WHY!? In times like these, it\u0026rsquo;s best not to ask why, but how!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s Micha-speak for \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rsquo;s absolutely no reason and I just felt like it\u0026rdquo;. So here it is:\nKiCad on Android: The First Guide Ever Note that I\u0026rsquo;ve taken care so that this guide can be followed even if your phone/tablet is your only device. If you have a computer on hand that you can/want to use, you should be able to omit the steps involving Shizuku and simply run the command mentioned in that section over ADB on your computer.\nPrerequisites A somewhat modern Android phone or tablet. It does not need to be rooted. Termux installed on your device, with storage set up (see its wiki, tl;dr: termux-setup-storage) Shizuku, a rootless privilege escalation system. This might be optional for your device, but I got an error code 9 while setting up TermuxArch, and the only on-device way I can think of to fix it is via Shizuku. Make sure to read [the instructions](https://shizuku.rikka.app/guide/setup/ #start-via-wireless-debugging) on how to set it up, as I won\u0026rsquo;t be covering that here! The AVNC app from F-Droid About 8GB of free space for KiCad with 3D models Basic experience working with the terminal Instructions Open Shizuku. Select \u0026ldquo;Use Shizuku in terminal apps\u0026rdquo;. Press \u0026ldquo;Export files\u0026rdquo; and select your Termux home directory from the sidebar. Open Termux and run nano ~/rish. Go to the end of the second-to-last line of the file (use Termux\u0026rsquo;s arrow keys) and change \u0026quot;PKG\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;com.termux\u0026quot;. Save and exit with Ctrl-s and Ctrl+x. Run sh ~/rish. Now, within the ADB shell, run /system/bin/device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 2147483647. This will disable the phantom process killer, which gets in the way of the next step. If there are no errors, press Ctrl-d to exit. Next, run curl -OL https://TermuxArch.github.io/TermuxArch/setupTermuxArch \u0026amp;\u0026amp; bash setupTermuxArch to install an Arch Linux environment. After it\u0026rsquo;s done, you\u0026rsquo;ll be in your new Arch installation. Run passwd user and set a password you\u0026rsquo;ll remember. After that, run su user to change to the default user account.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re nearly there!\nRun sudo pacman -Syu xfce4 xfce4-goodies tigervnc KiCad KiCad-library KiCad-library-3d and press Y when prompted. Finally, you can run vncserver :1 and connect via AVNC - the address will be 127.0.0.1:5901. Now, go to the menu in the top left, hover over Science, and tap on KiCad. Now, revel in the glory of running an app in a place it was never meant to be run!\nTo start it after the initial installation, open Termux, run startarch, run su user, and then run vncserver :1.\nTips You can change the XFCE font size by going to Applications \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Settings Manager \u0026gt; Appearance \u0026gt; Fonts \u0026gt; Default Font and setting the size at the bottom of the dialog. I set mine to 22.\nYou can also set AVNC to use touchpad mode, where your swipes on the phone screen move the cursor in the direction of the swipe instead of to your finger\u0026rsquo;s exact location on the screen. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to explain, but it\u0026rsquo;s handy on a small screen. To do this, go to AVNC and press \u0026amp; hold on your saved connection (save it if you haven\u0026rsquo;t done so, it won\u0026rsquo;t work with a one-time connection). Tap Advanced and change \u0026ldquo;Gesture style\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Touchpad\u0026rdquo;. Press Save in the top right and connect. Now, your cursor will use relative motions instead of absolute ones - handy!\nSomeone asked me if you can use an external mouse with this setup. There\u0026rsquo;s no reason why you couldn\u0026rsquo;t, so just connect it via USB or Bluetooth. The same should also work for a keyboard.\nTermux likes to gobble up your battery, so when you\u0026rsquo;re done and have saved your KiCad project, go to your notifications and kill the Termux session from its notification.\nEnjoy!\nP.S.

Sorry - I\u0026rsquo;ll try to not let that happen again!\nHey everyone! My last post on the E-Fidget was a quick status update on version 1. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve gone through 2 other versions of the main E-Fidget and two versions of its little sibling, the E-Fidget Lite.\nVersion 1 of the E-Fidget Lite Version 2 of the E-Fidget Lite The most recent version of the E-Fidget (The E-Fidget Lite V2, if you\u0026rsquo;re keeping count) is the most successful version so far! It uses a LRA motor to deliver sharp and accurate haptic feedback. As you can imagine, the cost of these PCBs adds up fast. Thankfully, PCBWay sponsored this version of the E-Fidget. They offer fast and professional services that you can always count on, and their support team is friendly and helpful!\nCheck them out at PCBWay.com\nThe new E-Fidget Lite has a few different modes. If you press and hold the button, it will vibrate repeatedly, a few times a second. If you press the button with arbitrary intervals between the presses, it will mimic the rhythm that you used! It takes a CR2032 coin battery. I\u0026rsquo;d estimate that it\u0026rsquo;ll last for about two weeks of light usage.\nI\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to sharing this project with the world, so check back soon for more details!\nThanks for reading!\n","permalink":"https://2231puppy.tech/posts/projects/e-fidget/update-3/","summary":"Yes, I know it\u0026rsquo;s been almost a full year since my last update.
