      <title>KiCad on Android: The PCB Design Setup No One Asked For</title>

      <description>What life? Why exist? How live? Why do I mean? If you find yourself asking asking these big questions, you&amp;rsquo;re probably a robot. No offense, ChatGPT. A real human would be asking much more important questions of themselves:
How the heck do I run KiCad on Android? Because there&amp;rsquo;s nothing more important in life than running an open-source EDA suite on your smartphone.
Whether or not that assumption is correct doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter.</description>

      <description>Yes, I know it&amp;rsquo;s been almost a full year since my last update. Sorry - I&amp;rsquo;ll try to not let that happen again!
Hey everyone! My last post on the E-Fidget was a quick status update on version 1. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through 2 other versions of the main E-Fidget and two versions of its little sibling, the E-Fidget Lite.
Version 1 of the E-Fidget Lite Version 2 of the E-Fidget Lite The most recent version of the E-Fidget (The E-Fidget Lite V2, if you&amp;rsquo;re keeping count) is the most successful version so far!</description>

      <description>Hello there! I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that the E-Fidget&amp;rsquo;s schematic and layout are complete! I&amp;rsquo;ve sent the gerber files out to a PCB manufacturer, and I&amp;rsquo;ve ordered all the parts. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a full ordering tutorial soon! In the meantime, here&amp;rsquo;s a preview: </description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;ve been working a little on the schematic for the E-Fidget, and it&amp;rsquo;s going great! Here&amp;rsquo;s what I have: (For those wondering, this is KiCad 6 with the Dracula color scheme on macOS.)
There are some changes that I have planned, like switching out the transistors for FETs (Thanks for suggesting that, you know who you are!). Cleaning up the schematic is also on my agenda. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ve started on the layout, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s ready to share quite yet (It&amp;rsquo;s ugly and not 10% done).</description>

      <description>Hello again! Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a project I&amp;rsquo;m calling the E-Fidget, a battery-powered fidget spinner for lazy people. Here&amp;rsquo;s the rundown:
How it works Essentially, there&amp;rsquo;s going to be some vibration motors, arranged in a circle. In the center, there&amp;rsquo;ll be a button to make the motors turn on and off very rapidly, in a circular motion. The idea is that this will emulate a spinning motion, while still working in your pocket!</description>

Skills: TS / Svelte / SvelteKit // TailwindCSS // Python / FastAPI // Godot
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a cool multiplayer combat-based MMO (yes, it&amp;rsquo;s gonna take a while) ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning relational database schemas.</description>
