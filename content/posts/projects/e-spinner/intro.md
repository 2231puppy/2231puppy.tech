Hello again! Recently, I've been working on a project I'm calling the E-Spinner, a battery-powered fidget spinner for lazy people. Here's the rundown:

### How it works

Essentially, there's going to be some vibration motors, arranged in a circle. In the center,
there'll be a button to make the motors turn on and off very rapidly, in a circular motion.
The idea is that this will emulate a spinning motion, while still working in your pocket!

### Software used

I'm designing the board in KiCad 6. I'm considering making V2 in Eagle ;)

### Hardware used

I'm going to be using the RP2040 microcontroller as the brains of the operation. It's going to have ~8 small, generic disc
vibration motors, driven by transistors.

#### That's all for now, check back later for updates :)
