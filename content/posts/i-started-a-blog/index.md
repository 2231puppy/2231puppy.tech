Hiya, internet! I'm 2231puppy/Micha, a teen programmer, game developer, aspiring digital musician, pixel artist, and vegan. I'll be blogging about
all of those things at one point or another. Here, you'll find my rants, notes, discoveries, and more! Check back soon for a new post!

Until next time!
